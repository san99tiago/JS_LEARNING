************************PROJECT_2 NOTES***************************

-------------------------BEFORE LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT_1 -----------------------
First, look at PROJECT_1_NOTES.txt to understand how to create the main JSON package
and to correctly add the "express" and "esm"  modules using npm.

Remeber that before we were executing commands in the terminal like this (any of them):
>> node server.js
>> node --experimental-modules m3.js
>> node -r esm server.js              (this one requires package "esm" installed)
(one of them should work fine, they are different available methods)
In this project, we will be looking on how to "automate" this task properly.



After those dependencies are installed, we will now start working with express!!!


-----------------------------SIMPLE SERVER-------------------------------------------
The server is going to be in "server.js" file.



---------------------------INITIALIZE SERVER-----------------------------------------
In order to be able to "initialize" our server.js , we will add a special instruction to 
the "package.json" file, that is going to execute correctly the server.
This is based on the "scripts" that the package.json gives us:
So inside the package.json file we add: 
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node -r esm server.js"
  },
This is basically telling us that when we run "start", the "node -r esm server.js" will run,
this gives us te advantage of "automating" some stuff.
So to start the server (the server.js file), now we have to run:
 >> npm start
 >> npm run start
 (both are exactly the same)
 (there are some that have "shortcuts" like the "npm start", but some other don't )


Now we can start to work propperly like the pro's!!

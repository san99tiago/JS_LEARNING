IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN JAVASCRIPT:

------------------ HOISTING --------------------
It is a concept that applies when defining variables with "var" or when we define
functions. It means that JavaScript "elevates" their defining to the top (first)
and then, it changes the variable value, to the specific one in line.
It also means that when a function is called, and there are local variables in its
scope, they will be create globally and could be accessed globally after.

Here is a video for a simple and powerful explanation:

--------------------- SCOPE --------------------
They are the part of "memory" that variables and the program can reach when implementing
specific functions and variables in the programs. There's is an important aspect 
here, which is that there are two main scopes: local and global scopes.
One importat remark is that when defining variables with "var", they are in the
global scope, while when defining them with "let", they achieve the local scope.
So it is a better approach to use "let", to respect the specific scope used.

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN JAVASCRIPT:

------------------ HOISTING --------------------
It is a concept that applies when defining variables with "var" or when we define
functions. It means that JavaScript "elevates" their defining to the top (first)
and then, it changes the variable value, to the specific one in line.
It also means that when a function is called, and there are local variables in its
scope, they will be created globally and could be accessed globally after.

Here is a video for a simple and powerful explanation:

--------------------- SCOPE --------------------
They are the part of "memory" that variables and the program can reach when implementing
specific functions and variables in the programs. There is an important aspect 
here, which is that there are two main scopes: local and global scopes.
One important remark is that when defining variables with "var", they are in the
global scope, while when defining them with "let", they achieve the local scope.
So it is a better approach to use "let", to respect the specific scope used.

------------------- COMMON ERROR -----------------
When using arrow functions in JS, it is common to have an error: calling "this"
and instead of getting the specific object attributes, we get the "window" 
object attributes, which means that we have to be careful when using these functions
and trying to change or access the "this" object structure.

-------------------- CALLSTACK -------------------
This is a JavaScript concept that applies when there are functions that pass
functions as arguments to other functions, and then they are able to call new
functions. A callback function can run only after other functions are finished.
They are amazing as "asynchronous functions", where one function has to wait
some unknown time for another function to finish (and there appears the concept)
of "callstack", or the "waiting line for a file to load/finish".

---------------------- JQUERY ----------------------
JQuery is a fast, small and feature-rich JavaScript library, that will allow us to
work with HTML documents, manipulations and event handling simpler with API.
In this simple JS course, it is useful for learning correctly the "callbacks".
We will be using JQuey with a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which is a special
server that is a group of servers that work together in a geographically distributed
location, to minimize delays on loading requests or websites.
To download it, we go into:
https://jquery.com
and click "Download JQuery" button and install the desired format/version.
(for this tutorial, I will be using JQuey with CDN 3x minified).

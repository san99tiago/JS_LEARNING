# NODEJS_FREECODECAMP  :trophy:
This is a basic course of the "node.js" environment. It is based on a series of free tutorials from FreeCodeCamp.

## Other messages
This whole repository is based on the main tutorial, but I added some improvements to the basic structures.

Good luck and I hope it's useful for you too. :alien: !
